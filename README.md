# Susie June's Cafe Website

Welcome to Susie June's Cafe website. Susie June's Cafe is a real cafe, which opened on the High Street in Starbeck in September 2023. The cafe is owned by two ladies, who are best friends with decades of catering experience and no interest in 'technology'. The cafe has a Facebook page run by the daughter of one of the owners, but they have no website, and no other web-presence.

Initially, the only reason the owners wanted a website for the cafe was because they were aware that when people searched the internet for their cafe, poor reviews and damaging photos of the previous establishment came up. They were very keen to wipe away any connection with the previous cafe, and for photos connected with the cafe name to be photos of their cafe and thier food. As time went on they became excited about the project and grew to have some very strong opinions about many other things that they wanted from a website.

A live version of the site can be viewed from [here.](https://elizabeth-yorke.github.io/SusieJunes-A/)

Here is a mock-up image of Susie June's Cafe website, using the "Am I Responsive" site.

## UX

I began the project by looking through the websites of competing cafes on my phone with my clients. I explained how these website reconfigured for larger screens and I suggested using the 'rule of thirds' where possible as it had been mentioned on my course. I sketched a number of design ideas as we went through this research, and I made a list of the features they were interested in as we went along. I had to explain things like the the burger icon, and that I wanted to add a couple of different pages via a navigation bar.

I explained that I would have to include certain elements (such as the form) for the purpose of my course, and that I could remove anything they didn't really want from the version I will be handing in before they use it. I also had to explain that although I would be making the website for free, they would have to pay hosting fees to a internet host of their choice if they wanted to use it. They looked up the prices of a number of different hosting sites and decided that this would be acceptable.

Looking at competitors websites was not as helpful as it could have been as it turned out there were no directly comparable independent cafe's nearby with websites. We looked at some of the big chain cafes that were nearby (Costa and Cafe Nero), and we looked at some more upmarket independent cafe's in the centre of Harrogate (Betty's, Bean & Bud and Baltharzen's). I really had to work at finding out what it was about one website that they liked more than another. I also talked to them about what they felt their unique selling points were, and what message they wanted to get over to the customer. 

### Wireframes

My wireframes were sketched on paper in front of the clients. There were many versions.
Here are screenshots of the wireframes we finally decided on:

| Page | Phone Wireframe | Desktop Wireframe |
| Home | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-home-phone.jpg) | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-home-desktop.jpg) | 
| Menu | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-menu-phone.jpg) | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-menu-desktop.jpg) | 
| Catering | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-catering-phone.jpg) | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-catering-desktop.jpg) | 
| Reservations | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-reservations-phone.jpg) | [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-reservations-desktop.jpg) | 

The menu page is significantly longer than it looks on the wireframe, but it follows the basic layout. The only significant change to these layouts came when we decided to add quotes from customers. I also figured out how to add a map in so I cam up with a way of including the quotes and balancing the look of the home page. Here is the revised home desktop wireframe [image](assets/wireframes/wireframe-home-update-desktop.jpg).

### Colour Scheme

In order to keep the website branding as close to the cafe branding as possible, I asked the owners for information on the colours they used in their branding. They didn't have any. So I used Adobe Color [https://color.adobe.com/create/image] to extract the colours from the cafe logo. [image](assets/documentation/adobe-color-wheel.png).

Of the colours identified, I was asked to make as much of the website as I could using the following three colours:
#F2F2F2 - off white
#33402A - dark green
#7E8C70 - mid green

with the following two colours for use if necesary:
#14260C - very dark green
#FFFFFF - white

### Fonts

Initially the clients wanted the exact font on their cafe frontage, but they didn't know what it was, so I used What The Font? [https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont?step=crop] to identify the font. The font was identifed as being Bernhard Fashion Std Roman. Unfortunately this font cost Â£40 to use, and the owners didn't want to pay that. So we spent a couple of hours searching Google Fonts in the cafe until they settled on a font that the felt was close enough to the realn font to be acceptable on the website.

They settled on using:
Edu TAS Beginner (for titles and for the slogan)
Roboto (for everything else)
They also said they were quite happy with the font that comes up automatically for 'mundane stuff' as it was 'nicer than the normal font on their menu anyway'.

## User Stories

The user stories I have collected below are authentic user stories, gleaned from interviewing people in the cafe and people walking around nreaby streets.

### New site users

I want the website to tell me where this cafe is.
I would like to know what kind of food they serve there.
I would like to read some reviews from other customers.

### New and returning site users

I want to be able to check what times and days it is open.
If I can bring my dog, I want to see it in writing on the website first before I have a wasted trip.
I want to be able to book a table.

### Returning customers

I want to reassure my friend that her wheelchair will fit in the cafe.
I want to find out if they do catering for functions.
I want links to social media on the website. I don't want to be copying loads of addresses out.

### Cafe Owners

We want our branding showing really strongly, so people know its not the last place.
We want photos of our food on the website, not someone else's.
We want honest reviews from our customers on there.
We want more people to know about us so we get more customers.
We don't want something we have to update or check in on.

## Features

### Existing Features

**Navigation bar with links**
This appears at the top of every page. It has words describing each page in the larger screen sizes and a dropdown menu in the smaller screen sizes.

**Logo links to homepage**
Every logo that you see can be clicked on and will return you to the homepage.

**Social links**
There is a link to the cafe Facebook page in the footer of every page.

**Embedded Map**
You can click on the + or - on the map to zoom in or out, making it easier to identify where the cafe is. If you click on 'view larger map' it will open google maps in a separate browser and you can access all the features Google Maps has to offer that way.

**Menu Downloads**
You can download both sides of the menu you will find on the tables in the cafe. This way you don't even need internet access to make your choice before you arrive.

**Reservation Form**
This form contains validation, so you can only move onto the next bit, it the answer you have already filled in makes sense. Note that only certain answers are required. The owners felt that a telephone numebr was necessary, but that an email address wasn't, as many of their elderly customers don't have emails.

**Audio Menu**
This is a special feature added because the cafe is located close to a specialist college for the visually imapired. Several customers have already trialled it on their phones, and they love it. It saves the owners a lot of time reading all the options out.

**Authentic food pictures and reviews from real customers**
These features were very important to the owners.

### Future Additions

**Bit Part Audio Menus**
The feedback I have had so far suggests that the cafe customers would like smaller audio menus for each section of the menu so they don't have to listen to the whole thing if they already know what sort of thing they would like.

**Better food pictures, and pictures of the actual people who gave the reviews**
I am still waiting for some photos to be supplied by the client.

**A 'More About Us' page**
Having done some more research and discussed it with the cafe owners, it looks as though adding an extra page with a bit of history or the cafe owners and their philosophy might actually bring more clients to their cafe. The cafe owners would like to make a point of their experience in the industry and advertise the fact that they strive to be a reasonably priced home from home. These facts are a little difficult to place on the website as it is.

## Testing

Please find details of testing on a separate page [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## Tools and Technologies Used

- HTML5 was used for the main site content.
- CSS3 was used for the main site design and layout.
- Git was used to commit and push versions of the website as it developed.
- GitHub was used for secure online code storage.
- GitHub Pages was used to host the deployed front-end site.
- Bootstrap was used as a framework for modern responsiveness and pre-built components.

- This project was initially started in Code Anywhere, but following numerous times when I couldn't access the site, or opening repositories took a long time, I switched to using Gitpod as my IDE, and completed the project using Gitpod.
